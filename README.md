# SWRCG
This is an open source random character generator for Oggdude's Character Generator data and/or nlx3674's dataset.

# Download
The application can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/mellondil/SWRCG/releases) from Releases.

Upon downloading the release, right-click the .zip file and open the Properties. Under the General tab, check Unblock, then click OK.

Unzip to a known location.

# Use
Open the application by launching the SWRCG.exe file.

The application will attempt to find data in the user's AppData Roaming folder by default, specifically: C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\SWCharGen\DataCustom\DataSet_Full_DataSet

If no data is found there, then click the Settings icon in the lower right corner. This will open the Settings dialog window.

Click the "..." button to open a folder picker dialog. Navigate to and select a dataset folder.

Note: The application will only load data from a dataset folder if the folder contains sub-folders of "Species", "Careers", and "Specializations" with "*.xml" data of their own.

Once the data is loaded, click the Generate Character button to generate a random character!

The application also contains a "SpecPreference.csv" file. This file contains a list of characteristic preferences for each specialization. For example, "ADVISOR,Presence,Cunning" would be an entry. Feel free to apply your own preferences to the downloaded copy.
